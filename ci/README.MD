# Zoe Continuous Integration
----------------------------

# Overview
- Integrate Zoe repository to Jenkins and SonarQube
- Each commit to Zoe repository trigger a build at Jenkins:
  - Run SonarQube Scanner to analyze the codebase
  - Create two containers for zoe-master, zoe-api
  - Run integration test [testing rest api]
  - Build new images if no errors happen
  - Deploy Zoe with latest images

# Software Stack
- Jenkins - version 2.7.4
- SonarQube - version 6.1

# Configuration
### Jenkins: all the configurations in this section is configured on Jenkins Server
- Required:
  - Plugins: Github plugin, SonarQube Plugin, Quality Gates, Email Plugin (optional), Cobertura Coverage Report (optional)
  - Softwares: Java, Python, Docker
    - Go to **Manage Jenkins**, then  **Global Tool Configuration** to setup Java SDK, SonarQube Scanner
- SonarQube server configuration: this aims to connect Jenkins and SonarQube together
  - Go to **Manage Jenkins** then **Configure System**
  - SonarQube servers: input name, server URL, server version, **sever authentication token** (created on SonarQube Server)
- Quality Gates configuration:
  - Go to **Manage Jenkins** then **Configure System**
  - Quality Gates: input name, server URL, username and password to login into SonarQube server
- Github Servers configuration:
  - Go to **Manage Jenkins** then **Configure System**
  - Github: **Add Github Server**, the API URL would be ``https://api.github.com``. The credentials creation is well defined in the document of Github plugin:
    - You can create your own [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) in your account GitHub settings.
    - Token should be registered with scopes:
      - admin:repo_hook - for managing hooks (read, write and delete old ones)
      - repo - to see private repos
      - repo:status - to manipulate commit statuses
    - In Jenkins create credentials as «Secret Text», provided by Plain Credentials Plugin      
- Create credentials for Github account: this is similar when you want to [connect to Github over SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/), here, beside adding your public key to Github, you also need to add your private key to Jenkins.
  - Create SSH key pair on the machine run Jenkins:
    - Add public key to Github
    - Add private key to Jenkins credentials
- Create new item as a **freestyle project**: this aims to create a Jenkins job with the github repository
  - General
    - Select Github project
    - Insert project URL
  - Source Code Management
    - Select **Git**
    - Repositories
      - Repository URL: use **SSH URL** of Github repository
      - Credentials: select the one created above
  - Build Triggers
      - For Github plugin with version before 1.25.1: Select **Build when a change is pushed to Github**
      - For Github plugin with version from 1.25.1: Select **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**
  - Build
      - Add **Execute SonarQube Scanner** to do SonarQube Analysis
      - Add **Quality Gates** to break the build when the SonarQube quality gate is not passed
      - Add **Execute Shell** to run script for testing, deploying. Please refer to the Appendix section for the script.
  - Post-build Actions [Optional]
     - Add **Publish Covetura Coverage Report** for getting report from coverage
       Due to the shell script in Appendix, the xml file generated by coverage is located at ``test`` folder, so, we should put ``**/tests/coverage.xml`` as the input of the field **Cobertura xml report pattern**.
     - Add **E-mail Notification** for notifying when jobs finish

### Github
- Add new SSH key (the one created on Jenkins server)
- Go to the project (which is integrated to Jenkins) settings
  - Integration & Services
    - Add Service, choose **Jenkins (Github plugin)**
    - Add Jenkins hook url
      - For github plugin, this one would have the format: http://your-jenkins.com/github-webhook/
      - In case your Jenkins doens't expose to the world, try [**ngrok**](https://ngrok.com/)

### SonarQube: all the configurations in this section is configured on SonarQube Server
- On **Administration**, go to **My Account**, then **Security**
- Generate Tokens, copy this and paste to **server authentication token** on Jenkins configuration
- The project needs to provides **sonar-properties** file in the repo: [Analyzing with SonarQube Scanner](http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner)

# Sonar properties files
Take a look at sonar-project.properties files at branch [**i34-t7.4.1**](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe-kpmg/tree/i34-t7.4.1), in root, ``zoe_api``, ``zoe_master``, ``zoe_lib``, ``zoe_fe`` folders.
